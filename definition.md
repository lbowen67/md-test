In programming, **bubble sort** is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. It continues to pass through the list until no more swaps are needed, which means the list is sorted.

**How it works:**
1. Start at the beginning of the list.
2. Compare the first two elements.
3. If the first is greater than the second, swap them.
4. Move to the next pair and repeat until the end of the list.
5. After each pass, the largest unsorted element "bubbles up" to its correct position.
6. Repeat the process for the remaining unsorted portion of the list.
