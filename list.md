A **list** is a built-in **ordered, mutable (changeable), and indexable** data structure in Python that can hold a collection of items. Items in a list can be of mixed data types (e.g., strings, integers, other lists).

**Syntax:**
```
my_list = [item1, item2, item3]
```
**Example:**
```
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

print(fruits[0])        # Output: apple (indexing)
fruits.append("orange") # Adds 'orange' to the end
fruits.remove("banana") # Removes 'banana'

print(fruits)           # Output: ['apple', 'cherry', 'orange']
```
You can create an **empty list** by using the square brackete with nothing in beteen them.
```
   my_list = []
```

You can create a **list with items** in Python by placing them inside square brackets, separated by commas. For example:
```
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
mixed = [1, 'hello', 3.14, True, numbers, fruits]
```

**Practice**
```python3.run
# Practice making a list
